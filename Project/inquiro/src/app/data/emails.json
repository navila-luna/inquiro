Employer contributions can be made up until the tax filing deadline in 2024 (including extensions).\n2.  **Paying your husband:** Yes, you can pay him a salary as an independent contractor. It's important that the compensation is reasonable for the work performed and that you issue him a 1099-NEC form at the end of the year. We can help with that.\n3.  **Accounting Software:** Many of our clients have been happy with Xero as an alternative to Quickbooks. It has a clean interface and robust features. We could also explore Wave, which is a good free option for smaller businesses.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to discuss any of these further.\n\nBest,\nBob"

Based on your numbers (120/800 sq ft), you can deduct 15% of your direct home expenses like rent, utilities, and renter's insurance. Make sure you keep detailed records.\n\nRegarding college tuition, that falls under personal tax planning. While our firm primarily handles your business accounting, I can tell you that you should look into the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC). You may need to consult with a personal tax advisor for specifics on your eligibility.\n\nHope this helps!\nAlice"

Taking too little salary is a major red flag. We need to determine a reasonable salary based on your role, experience, and what others in your industry earn. After paying that salary, you can take the remaining profit as a distribution, which is not subject to self-employment taxes."

The actual expense method involves tracking the business percentage of all your car costs (gas, repairs, insurance, depreciation). For most people, the standard mileage rate is easier and often results in a similar deduction. However, if you have a newer, more expensive car or high maintenance costs, tracking actual expenses might be better. Either way, a detailed mileage log is essential."
